It is necessary that we should, in this place, give an exact 
Idea of the dwelling: of the Bishop of D.

VI. — Who guarded his Rouse for his. 

Tbe house in which he lived consisted, as we have said, of 
a ground floor, and one story above; three rooms on the 
ground floor, three chambers oq the first, and an attic above. 
Behind the house was a garden, a quarter* of an acre in ex- 
tent. The two women occupied the first floor ; the Bishop was 
lodged below. The first room, opening on the street, served 
him as dining-room, the second was his bedroom, and ih% third 
his oratory. There was no exit possible from this oratory, ex- 
cept by passing through the bedroom, nor from the bedroom, 
without passing through the dining-room. At the end of the 
suite, in the oratory, there was a detached alcove with a bed, 
for use in cases of hospitality. The Bishop offered this bed to 
country curates whom business or the requirements of their 
parishes brought to D. 

The pharmacy of the hospital, a small building which had 
been added to the house, and abutted on the garden, had been 
transformed into a kitchen and cellar. In addition to this, 
there was in the gai'den a stable, which had formerk been the 
kitchen of the hospital, and in which the Bishop kept two cows. 
No matter what the quantity of milk they gave, he invariably 
sent half of it every morning to the sick people in the hospital. 
^^ I am paying my tithes^" he said. 

His bedroom was tolerably lai^e, and rather difiScult to warm 
in bad weather. As wood is extremely dear at D., he hit upon 
tbe idea of having a compartment of boards constructed in the 
oow-shed. Here he passed his evenings during seasons of severe 
cold : he called it his winter salon. 

In this winter salon, as in the dining-room, there was no 
other furniture than a square table in white wood, and four 
straw-seated chairs. In addition to this the dining-room was 
ornamented with an antique sideboard painted pink, in water- 
3olors. Out of a similar sideboard, properly draped with white 
napery and imitation lace, the Bishop had constructed the altar 
which decorated his oratory. 

His wealthy penitents and the sainted women of D. had more 
than once assessed themselves to raise the money for a new 
altar for Monseigncur's oratory ; on each occasion lie had taken 
the money and had given it to the poor. '' The most beautiful 
of altars," he said, ^^ is the soul of an unhappy creature cou< 
soled and thanking God." 

In his oratory there were two straw prie-Dieu, and there was 
an arm-chair, also in straw, in his bedroom» When, by chance,

he received seven or eight persons at one time, the prefect, ot 
ihe general, or the staflf of the regiment in garrison, or several 
pupils from the little seminary, the cliairs had to be fetched 
from the winter salon in the stable, the prie-Dieii from the ora- 
tory, and the arm-chair from the bedroom : in this way as many 
as eleven chairs could be collected for the visitors. A room 
was dismantled for each new guest. 

It sometimes happened that there were twelve in the party ; 
the Bishop then relieved the embarrassment of the situation b\* 
standing in front of the chimney if it was winter, or by strolling 
in the garden if it was summer. 

There was still another chair in the detached alcove, but the 
straw was half gone from it, and it had but three legs, so that 
it was of service only when propped against the wall. Madem- 
oiselle Baptistine had also in her own room a very large easy- 
chair of wood, which had formerl}' been gilded, and which was 
covered with flowered pekin ; but thej^ had been obliged to 
hoist this bergère up to the first story through the window, as 
the staircase was too narrow ; it could not, tlierefore, be reck- 
oned among the possibilities in the way of furniture. 

Mademoiselle Baptistine's ambition had been to be able to 
purchase a set of drawing-room furniture in yellow Utrecht vel- 
vet, stamped with a rose pattern, and with mahogany in swan's- 
neck style, with a sofa. But this would have cost five hundred 
francs at least, and in view of the fact that she had only been 
able to lay by forty-two francs and ten sous for this purpose 
in the course of five years, she had ended by renouncing the 
idea. However, who is there who has attained his ideal? 

Nothing is more easy to present to the imagination than the 
Bishop's bedchamber. A glazed door opened on the garden ; 
opposite this was the bed, — a hospital bed of iron, witli a can- 
opy of gi-een serge ; in the shadow of the bed, behind a curtain, 
were the utensils of the toilet, which still betrayed the elegant 
habits of the man of the world : there were two doors, one 
near the chimney, opening into the oratory ; the other near the 
bookcase, opening into the dining-room. The bookcase was a 
large cupboard with glass doors filled with books ; the chimnc}- 
was of wood painted to represent marble, and habitually with- 
out fire. In the chimney stood a pair of firedogs of iron, orna- 
mented above with two garlanded vases, and fiutings which had 
formerly been silvered with silver leaf, whicli was a sort of 
episcopal luxury ; above the chimney-piece hung a crucifix of 
copper, with the silver worn off, fixed on a background of thread- 
bare black velvet in a wooden frame from which the gilding ha^

fallen ^ near the glass door a large table with an inkstand, loaded 
with a confusion of papers and witli huge volumes ; before the 
table an arm-chair of straw ; in front of the bed a prie-Dieu, 
borrowed from the oratory. 

Two }x>rtrait8 in oval frames were fastened to the wall on 
each side of the bed. Small gilt inscriptions on the plain sur- 
face of the cloth at the side of these figures indicated that 
the portraits represented, one the Abbé of Chaliot, bisiiop 
of Saint-Claude ; the other, the Abbé Tourteau, vicar-general 
of Agde, abbé of Grand-Champ, order of Cîteaux, diocese of 
Chartres. When the Bishop succeeded to this apartment, after 
the hospital patients, he had found these portraits there, and 
had left them. They were priests, and probabl}' donors — two 
reasons for respecting them. All that he knew about these two 
persons was, that they had been appointed by the king, the one 
to his bishopric, the other to his benefice, on the same daj-, the 
27th of April, 1785. Madame Magloire having taken the pic- 
tures down to dust, the Bishop had discovered these particulars 
written in whitish ink on a little square of paper, yellowed by 
time, and attached to the back of the portrait of the Abbé of 
Grand-Champ with four wafers. 

At his window he had an antique curtain of a coarse woollen 
stuff, which finally became so old, that, in order to avoid the 
expense of a new one, Madame Magloire was forced to take a 
lai^e seam in the very middle of it. This seam took the form 
of a cross. The Bishop often called attention to it: " How 
delightful that is ! '' he said. 

All the rooms in the house, without exception, those on the 
ground floor as well as those on the first floor, were white- 
washed, which is a fashion in barracks and hospitals. 

However, in their latter years, Madame Magloire discovered 
beneath the paper which had been washed over, paintings orna- 
menting the apartment of Mademoiselle Baptistine, as we shall 
Bee further on. Before becoming a hospital, this house had 
been the ancient parliament house of the Bourgeois. Hence 
this decoration. The chambers were paved in red bricks, which 
were washed every week, with straw mats in front of all the 
beds. Altogether, this dwelling, which was attended to by the 
two women, was exquisitely clean from top to bottom. Thi» 
was the sole luxury which the Bishop permitted. He said, 
" That takes notMvg from the poor.'' 

Ft must be confessed, however, that he still retained fVorn his 
former possessions six silver knives and forks and a soup- 
ladle, which Madame Magloire contemplated every day with

delight, as they glistened splendidly upon the coarse linei^ cloth* 
And since we are now painting the Bishop of D. as he was in 
reality, we must add that he had said more than once, ^^ I find 
it difficult to renounce eating from silver dishes.*' 

To this silverware must be added two large candlesticks of 
massive silver, which he had inherited from a great-aunt- 
These candlesticks held two wax candles, and usually figured 
on the Bishop's chimney-piece. When he had any one to din- 
ner, Madame Magloire lighted the two candles and set the 
candlesticks on the table. 

In the Bishop's own chamber, at the head of his bed, there, 
was a small cupboard, in which Madame Magloire locked up 
the six silver knives and forks, and the big s[K)on every night. 
But it is necessary to add, tliat the key was never removed. 

The garden, which had been rather spoiled by the ugly build- 
mgs which we have mentioned, was composed of four alleys in 
cross-form, radiating from a tank. Another walk made the 
circuit of the garden, and skirted the white wall which enclosed 
it. These alleys left behind them four square plots rimmed 
with box. In three of these Madame Magloire cultivated 
vegetables ; in the fourth, the Bishop had planted some flowers ; 
here and there stood a few fruit-trees. Madame Magloire had 
once remarked, with a sort of gentle malice : " Monseigneur, 
you who turn everything to account have, nevertheless, one use- 
less plot. It would be better to grow salads there than bou- 
quets." ''Madame Magloire," retorted the Bishop, "you ai*6 
mistaken. The beautiful is as useful as the useful." He 
added after a pause, *' More so, perhaps."
